optimizations
1. uses yolo nano
2. checks posture every 2-3 seconds and not continuously
3. downscaled frame

Preventing false positives:
Keep a timestamped queue of posture checks.
If user is "Hunched!" or "Leaning Back" in ‚â•4 out of the last 5 checks
AND the bad streak has lasted for ‚â•30 seconds,
‚Üí trigger notification.
Reset the timer when posture improves.

Caretaker üéÄ ‚Äì Posture Monitoring App
This is a desktop app that uses your webcam and YOLOv8 pose detection to track your sitting posture in real time.
It will warn you if you sit in a bad posture for too long.

‚ú® Key Features
Real-time posture tracking using YOLOv8 pose model.

Detects three states:

‚úÖ Good Posture

‚ö†Ô∏è Leaning Back

‚ùå Hunched

Bad posture detection rule:

If 4 out of the last 5 posture checks are bad and

Bad posture continues for 30 seconds or more ‚Üí notification is shown.

Snooze option in notification to pause alerts for 10 minutes.

Pause / Resume posture monitoring any time.

Simple PyQt5 interface with live camera feed.

Since distance to the screen is subtle and we need eye landmarks (iris centers), MediaPipe is better ‚Äî faster and more battery-friendly for this feature.

no calibration for easy use of app.
MEDIAPIPE IRIS
Uses MediaPipe FaceMesh for iris landmarks (468 and 473).
Iris diameter (D) = 11.7‚ÄØmm (standard from MediaPipe research).
Focal length (f) = assume ~900 pixels (reasonable for typical 720p/1080p laptop webcams).
Bad condition = distance < 60‚ÄØcm.
Notification trigger = if 4 out of last 5 checks are bad AND bad streak lasts ‚â•‚ÄØ30 seconds.
Includes pause/resume and snooze for 10 minutes like in your posture code.
